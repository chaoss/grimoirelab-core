  Organizing log data in a structured format makes easier
  to read and analyze it. After adding 'structlog',
  log messages will always have a structured format.

  The default mode prints the messages to the console
  in plain format, but it can also be configured to print
  them in JSON format by setting the environment variable
  'GRIMOIRELAB_LOGS_JSON' to 1 or 'true'.
