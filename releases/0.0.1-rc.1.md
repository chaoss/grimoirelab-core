## grimoirelab-core 0.0.1-rc.1 - (2025-01-16)

We are excited to announce the release of the GrimoireLab scheduler,
a distributed job queue designed to fetch data from software
repositories using Perceval.

Key Features:

- Repository Management: Add repositories via a REST API, automatically
transforming them into Perceval jobs.

- Efficient Job Execution: Distributed workers execute one job at a time,
pulling tasks from the queue and ensuring seamless data retrieval.

- Continuous Updates: Successfully completed jobs are re-scheduled to
fetch new data periodically.

- Redis Integration: Data fetched by each job is published to a Redis
queue by default.

This release enhances scalability in GrimoireLab.
